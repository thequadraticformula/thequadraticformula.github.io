# TheWishGame

This is a game where you give wishes to a genie, and the genie tries to ruin the wish for you. 

The 404 page is just a clone of Flappy Bird.

blappyfird.html is also flappy bird, but some of the text is different

The python.html file is a clone of Snake.

ttt.html is Tic-Tac-Toe.

The genie doesn't work because I don't know how to use Github secrets, so the API key may or may not be in the client-side code.
